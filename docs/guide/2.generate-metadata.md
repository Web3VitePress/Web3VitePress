# Step. 2: Generate blog metadata

Now we can start generate the blog NFT's metadata.

```sh
folder=demo-blog node generateCID.js
```

This command will publish your blog article on to IPFS and auto generate new blog article's CID and store them into the `data.json`.

You can find your blog article's CID and copy it into your article's `frontmatter` field

```md
---
contractAddress: xxxx
imageCID: yyyy
contentCID: zzzz
---

```
