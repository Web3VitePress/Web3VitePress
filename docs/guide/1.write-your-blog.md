# Step. 1: Write your blog

Create your new article folder in the `docs`.

We make a `demo-blog` folder for example.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo-blog
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clonex.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ doodle.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clonex.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ doodle.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.md
```

Then, try to access <http://localhost:5173/demo-blog/clonex.html> and you should see the content of clonex.md is shown.

The `clonex.md` content looks like this
